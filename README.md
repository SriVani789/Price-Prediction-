# Price-Prediction
## SVM Classification and Regression

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for both classification and regression tasks. Two different datasets have been usedâ€”one for classification (Iris dataset) and another for regression (house price prediction).

## SVM Classification with Iris Dataset
### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of features representing sepal and petal dimensions for three different iris species.

### Model Training
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
2. Extracted relevant features and labels.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Utilized the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel for model training.
5. Calculated the classification accuracy on the test set.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed.
3. Run the script (`svm_classification_iris.py`).
4. Interact with the SVC model for iris species classification.
